```
An video named test.mp4 will be generated by then,
## Announcement

You might need to get your own consumer keys from Twitter and credential from Google Vision. Fill then into the required place in the code and download the picture as many as you can.

MiniProject 3

Using Mysql and MongoDB to store the history of searching into a local database.

## Usage

Using these functions to save the data, you can see the annotations for more information
sqlrecord(screen_name,picture_urls)
mongorecord(picture_urls)

While running your database after downloads, try
```
mysql -u root -p
```

If you want to check the content of the database, try
```
use databasename #change to your database
select * from tablename #change to your table
```
